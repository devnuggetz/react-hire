## Why React-Hire?

<p>Imagine you're on treasure hunt but you don't have a map. Sounds absurdm, right? This is how we do job hunting. We randomly look for startups, their career page and spend hours only to see that they are not using framework/tech that we know (in this case ReactJS). So, to ease your pain a little, this website will show you all the Indian Startups, personally verified that are using ReactJS as their frontend framework.</p>

## Upcoming feature?

<ul>
<li>Search Option</li>
<li>Sort and Filter</li>
<li>Full fleged backend</li>
</ul>
